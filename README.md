# iTunesWebPresence
Bring iTunes / Apple Music song info to your own website embed. Similar to [spotify-web-presence](https://github.com/dev-sda1/spotify-web-presence)

# Prerequisites
- NodeJS and npm (sadly this was done with express)
- Windows PC with iTunes installed. Microsoft Store version may be glitchy, so for optimal stability I advise using the desktop version. (Apologies, macOS and Linux users D:)
- A webserver to host the endpoint on

# Setting up the Server


# Setting up the Client
You have two options for getting the client - either compiling from source or downloading a binary from the Releases tab.
